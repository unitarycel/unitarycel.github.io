A postdoctoral research position in machine learning for single-cell biology is available at the Single-Cell Data Science (SCDS) core, Texas A&M University (TAMU), College Station, Texas, USA. The postdoc will work within the framework of the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT)-funded project ‘GENE - ENVIRONMENT - LIFESTYLE INTERACTIONS IN CANCER’. The overall theme of the project is to create a regional center of excellence in cancer research that takes advantage of the vast resources available to Texas A&M University to establish the infrastructure required to advance a cohesive vision to address unmet needs in cancer prevention and treatment at the regional and national levels.

Advanced single-cell barcoding and sequencing technologies allow the analysis of tumor heterogeneity, evolution, and microenvironment by combining multi-omics data sets, which include spatial information from individual cells. The SCDS core was created to facilitate the process and analysis of single-cell systems data and to bring together the Data Sciences and Life Sciences communities at TAMU in a novel way. It is proposed to complement and improve traditional hypothesis-driven research by flipping the model for cancer biology research around so that data drives the experiments leading to novel hypotheses. The core values of SCDS include using bioinformatics and advanced computation to augment our ability to achieve a data-driven approach to life sciences/cancer biology problems and maintaining a strong informatics skill-set necessary for unraveling and integrating data sets from various single-cell sources and technologies.

The Cai Lab ([https://cailab-tamu.github.io/](https://cailab-tamu.github.io/))  and Ni Lab ([https://web.stat.tamu.edu/~yni/](https://web.stat.tamu.edu/~yni/)) are looking for a talented, dynamic, and dedicated researcher who is a team player and excited to drive forward this project. Interested candidates should have a PhD in machine learning, bioinformatics, single-cell data analysis, and/or a related field and a demonstrable publication record. Those with experience in multi-omics, graphical/network models, data integration, and Bayesian statistics are particularly encouraged to apply. Experience in single-cell multi-omic data analysis would be highly beneficial, and in collaborating with biomedical scientists. The candidate should have good programming and communication skills.

The position is initially one year and is extendable given satisfactory performance. The anticipated start date is May 2023. For informal inquiries or to apply, please contact Dr. James Cai ([jcai@tamu.edu](mailto:jcai@tamu.edu)) and/or Dr. Yang Ni ([yni@stat.tamu.edu](mailto:yni@stat.tamu.edu)). For applications, please send a 1-page cover letter (highlighting your interest and relevant experience) and CV (with contact information for three references).
